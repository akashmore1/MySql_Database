# String Functions

## Concat

```
SELECT
  CONCAT(author_fname, ' ', author_lname) AS full_name
FROM books;

### ConcatWs (concat with symbol)

    CONCAT_WS(' - ', title, author_fname, author_lname)
FROM books;

## Substring

**SUBSTRING()** function is more like **slice()** in javascrpt

```
SELECT CONCAT
    (

        '...'
    )

ðŸ‘†Replaces all book titles' **e** with **3**

```
SELECT
    SUBSTRING(REPLACE(title, 'e', '3'), 1, 10) AS 'weird string'
FROM books;
```
