# CHAR and VARCHAR

1. CHAR has a fixed length.
2. VARCHAR is a bit more flexible.
3. If we have a variable of type CHAR with 4 characters, we every variable will have 4 length.
4. If we pass value more than 4, it will be truncated to 4 and if we pass less value than 4 extra spaces will be added until length is 4.
5. VARCHAR is dynamic, if we assign length 4 to varchar, and assign value less than 4 then unlike CHAR spaces will not be added.
6. Use CHAR when you know exact length of character for every variable. e.g. (yes/no) : y (or) n -> only 1 character.

# DECIMAL

```
CREATE TABLE items (
    price DECIMAL(7,4)
);
```

1. In above case maximum number of character for price is going to be 7.
2. There will be 4 decimals characters in this number.
3. So maximum number that can be saved in price is 999.9999
4. DECIMAL is used for precision.
5. If we insert very large number more than 999.9999 (in this case), mamixum value is automatically added to price i.e 999.9999
6. Also if there are more than 4 decimals then value will be rounded upto 4 decimals.
7. e.g. 6.99999999 will become 7.0000

# FLOAT and DOUBLE

1. Difference between FLOAT, DOUBLE and DECIMAL are quite technical and how they are stored in memory
2. FLOAT and DOUBLE can stored larger numbers with lesser memory compared to DECIMAL.
3. But this is compromised by pricision.
4. DECIMAL take more space than FLOAT or DOUBLE but it is very accurate.
5. While Float occupy less space but not accurate. Float is not precise after 7 character digits.
6. DOUBLE is not precise after 15 character digits.

```
CREATE TABLE thingies (price FLOAT);

INSERT INTO thingies(price) VALUES (88.45);

SELECT * FROM thingies;

INSERT INTO thingies(price) VALUES (8877.45);

SELECT * FROM thingies;

INSERT INTO thingies(price) VALUES (8877665544.45);

SELECT * FROM thingies;
```

# DATE, TIME, DATETIME

Format for DATETIME is 'yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss'

```
CREATE TABLE people (name VARCHAR(100), birthdate DATE, birthtime TIME, birthdt DATETIME);

INSERT INTO people (name, birthdate, birthtime, birthdt)
VALUES('Padma', '1983-11-11', '10:07:35', '1983-11-11 10:07:35');

INSERT INTO people (name, birthdate, birthtime, birthdt)
VALUES('Larry', '1943-12-25', '04:10:42', '1943-12-25 04:10:42');

SELECT * FROM people;
```

# CURDATE(), CURTIME(), NOW()

1. CURDATE() - gives current date
2. CURTIME() - gives current time
3. NOW() - gives current datetime

```
INSERT INTO user(name, birthdate, birthtime, birthdt)
values("Vishwesh", CURDATE(), CURTIME(), NOW());
```

# Formatting Dates

1. DAY() gives day in number

```
SELECT name, DAY(birthdate) from user;
```

ðŸ‘†return 30 in my case, cause my birthday is 30th oct

2. DAYNAME() gives sunday, monday.... etc

```
SELECT name, birthdate, DAYNAME(birthdate) FROM user;
```

returns:

| name     | birthdate  | DAYNAME(birthdate) |
| -------- | ---------- | ------------------ |
| Akash    | 1998-10-30 | Friday             |
| Vishwesh | 1998-10-09 | Friday             |

3. DAYOFWEEK() gives number of day in a week (sunday is 1, saturday is 7)

4.DAYOFYEAR() gives number of day in year. (1 january is 1, 31 dec is 365)

**_These functions can be applied on both DATE and DATETIME datatypes._**

4. HOUR() gives hour
5. MINUTE() gives minute
6. HOUR() and MINUTE() acn be applied on TIME and DATETIME datatypes.
7. Always refer mysql documentation for this
   `https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/date-and-time-type-syntax.html`
8. We have DATE_FORMAT() function we pass date to it and a string of special character as second argument for format in which we want date

```
SELECT DATE_FORMAT(birthdt, 'Was born on a %W') FROM people;

SELECT DATE_FORMAT(birthdt, '%m/%d/%Y') FROM people;

SELECT DATE_FORMAT(birthdt, '%m/%d/%Y at %h:%i') FROM people;
```

# DATEDIFF()

used to find different between to datetimes
