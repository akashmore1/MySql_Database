# CHAR and VARCHAR

1. CHAR has a fixed length.
2. VARCHAR is a bit more flexible.
3. If we have a variable of type CHAR with 4 characters, we every variable will have 4 length.
4. If we pass value more than 4, it will be truncated to 4 and if we pass less value than 4 extra spaces will be added until length is 4.
